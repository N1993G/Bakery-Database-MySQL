# Bakery-Database-SQL
Introduction to SQL and Data Science
• Create a database called Bakery. 
• Let’s add two tables to the database. One should be called ‘Sweet’ 
and the one should be called ‘Savoury’
• The Sweet table should have three columns: id (which is a number), 
item_name (name of a pastry) and price (prices can be expressed in 
pound and pennies) 
• Include the same columns in the Savoury table. In addition, add a 
column called main_ingredient (it will be a descriptive word)
We need to populate tables that we created in the Bakery database. At the 
moment they are like empty shells. Let’s add some data to get results.
